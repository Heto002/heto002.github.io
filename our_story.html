    <h2 style="color:black">Years Of Digital Transformation Success</h2>
    <p style="color:black">Tansaga Technologies was founded in 2023 by Hendro Hartanto and Santi Lauw, immigrants from Indonesia. Santi, with over 20 years of IT experience, began her IT career in Indonesia and continued it across Australia and New Zealand, before finally settling down in Canada. Her journey with ServiceNow started in 2016 while working at a post-secondary institution, where she immediately developed a passion for the platform. At this point, she found a lack of personnel who knew the entire ServiceNow platform that she could ask for help. This made her aspire to learn and challenge all 20 certifications, so that she could help her clients by providing a high-level overview of the entire platform.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="color: black;">Inspired by Santiâ€™s enthusiasm for IT, her sons, Harry and Henry, began learning programming in high school. This became a foundation for them when they would later enter the ServiceNow industry during their high school and university years.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="color: black;">To this day, Santi, Harry, and Henry are all Certified Technical Architects, each holding all 20 mainline ServiceNow certifications.</p>
